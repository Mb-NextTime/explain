# Implemented features

- Simple auto-ml on binary classification tasks
- Dataset exploration:
  - Correlations
  - Dataset size vs metric score plot
- Easier to understand representations of model performance & metric scores
- Model explanation algorithms:
  - SHAP
  - ICE

# TODO:
- Continue adding features
- Add proper docstrings
- Extend to web application? - we stride for having not only a python module but also a more user-friendly interface
